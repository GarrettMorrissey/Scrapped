## Known Issues:
* **Debugger/Player Menu:** In this milestone, the debugger was made in a separate menu that you can find in the Pause Menu. Next milestone, the debugger will be working during the gameplay with key cheats. The spawn and stats works properly.
* **Gym map:** We had a git problem 3 days before the end of m1, so we lost the level design of the Gym map. We end up making a new basic map were you can test all the features, so it looks different of what we have been showing.
* **Wwise:** We encounter a lot of problems with Wwise, we had to set it up 4 times in one day, also it wasn't allowing us to make builds. We asked for help and we were told by Quin that he will help us next milestone. We were able to access the soundbanks and make sound channels so we can play sounds and partially change the volume with a slider.
* **Audio Slider:** When you change anything from the audio slider it mutes the game.
* **Collisions:** Both bullets and Bash seem to have bigger collisions than their collider would suggest, would need a mentor's help to figure the issue out.
* **Enemies:** Enemies sometimes have their bullets shoot in reverse.
* **Animation & rigging:** The main character is fully rigged, but we ran out of time to integrate it.
* **Code rewrite:** Player movement will have to be adjusted to work for a walking character and not a rolling ball.
